Question #1

Given some set of values (ages, address numbers, etcâ€¦), we might want to know what the minimum and maximum values are in that set. 
Since the minimum and maximum values are related, we can organize them in a struct, like so:
    struct minMax
    {
        int min; // holds the minimum value seen so far
        int max; // holds the maximum value seen so far
    };
However, as written, this struct has an unspecified class invariant. What is the invariant?
*/

// the max can be smaller than the min
