Question #1
    What’s the difference between a variable’s scope, duration, and linkage? 
    What kind of scope, duration, and linkage do global variables have?
Answer: 
    Scope is where a variable is accesibl. duration is the how long the variable lives. Linkage tells if the variable can be used in other places(like different files).
    global variables have global scope, static duration (lasts until the file ends), and either internal (single file), or external(multiple files) linkage.
