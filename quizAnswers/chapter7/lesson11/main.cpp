Question #1
    What effect does using keyword static have on a global variable? 
    What effect does it have on a local variable?
Answer:
    Using static on a global variable makes the variable only usable in the file it was defined also known as having internal linkage.
    Using static on a local variable makes it a type of global variable that dies at the end of 
    a file but is out of scope when the block it was defined in ends.
