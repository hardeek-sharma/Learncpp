/*
Question #1

What does the following program print? Donâ€™t run it, use a reference to figure out what erase does.
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>

    int main()
    {
    std::string str{ "The rice is cooking" };

    str.erase(4, 11);

    std::cout << str << '\n';

    return 0;
    }
