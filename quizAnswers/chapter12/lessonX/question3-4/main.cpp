/*
Question #3) 
Name two reasons why we prefer to pass arguments by const reference instead of by non-const reference whenever possible.

// So we don't accidentally change a value we didn't want to change.
// So the function can accept rvalue with reference too.

Question #4) 
What is the difference between a const pointer and a pointer-to-const?

// A const pointer is a pointer that can only point to one address
// A point-to-const means a pointer cant change the value of what its pointing at through the pointer
